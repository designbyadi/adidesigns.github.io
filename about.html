    <h1>Rochester Website Redesign</h1>
    <img src="project-image-url.jpg" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>The municipal website for Rochester, NY is over eleven years old and is in need of a redesign that will better engage, connect, and inform constituents. 

<br><br>

Residents, business owners, visitors, and others need to be able to access the site, do business with the City, and find answers to their inquiries. The goal is to create a design that is free of clutter, easy to navigate, and will leave a positive impression on visitors.</p>

    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>
    <p>Revamped the home page and waste collection process.</p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
     <section>
        <h3>Diversify Typography, Simplify Categories, Use Logical Groupings</h3>
        <p>I wanted to provide a more intuitive user experience by designing the navigation to effortlessly guide users to the information or services they're seeking. The site is now organized into clear sections based on user needs, with detailed subcategories for more in-depth navigation. I also wanted to streamline content by reducing and clearly defining categories, which minimizes clutter and enhances decision-making for users. </p>
