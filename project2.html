    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>
    <p>I undertook a comprehensive overhaul of the homepage and the waste collection information process. The goal was to transform an outdated, difficult-to-navigate website with a confusing hierarchy into a streamlined, user-friendly interface. Specifically, I aimed to simplify access to waste pickup information, making it straightforward for residents to find and understand the services they need. This initiative was driven by the need to enhance the overall usability of the site, ensuring that essential services like waste collection are easily accessible to all users.</p>
    
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
     <section>
        <h3>Flight</h3>
        <p>This was a personal project to me because I felt like I had transformed in school and wanted to portray that in whimsical manner while also playing with texture. I chose the word "flight" and had the word come to completion after the letter "I" flies up to it. Camera angles. </p>
