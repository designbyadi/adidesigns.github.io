    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>The primary objective of the RIT University News website redesign is to create a platform that effectively communicates the happenings within the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) community. My design choices should boost the visibility of RIT news and foster greater participation in RIT events and grow the overall number of website visitors and extend the duration of each visit through a more engaging and informative user experience.</p>

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>The redesign focuses on delivering a visually engaging, captivating, and informative user experience. Key elements of the design philosophy include a modern and aesthetically pleasing design that draws users in and encourages exploration. I wanted to organize content in a way that guides the user's eye through the website, making important information stand out and easy to find. My plan was ater to various reading behaviors such as scanning, jumping, and sustained reading through optimal legibility and content presentation.I also tried to ensure that the website is user-friendly and accessible, allowing users to navigate through the site effortlessly.</p>

    <h2>Identified Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>The current RIT University News website faces challenges in content organization, consistent style, and spacing, leading to distractions and reduced readability. To address these issues, the redesign focuses on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content Hierarchy: By refining the content hierarchy, the redesign aims to prioritize information effectively, allowing users to quickly identify the most important news and events.</li>
        <li>Grid Structure: Implementing a more coherent grid structure enhances the organization of the website, making it visually appealing and easier to navigate.</li>
        <li>Visual Appeal: Elevating the website's visual appeal through consistent styling, appropriate spacing, and engaging graphics to create a more pleasant and inviting online environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Website</h2>
     <section>
        <p>There’s a secret ingredient to this growth and appeal: RIT's news website can be attributed to a well-executed infusion of bold branding elements. Through the strategic implementation of a highly accessible design, the distinctive Oswald font, and strategically segmented sections, the website successfully encapsulates the spirit and boldness of RIT.</p>
